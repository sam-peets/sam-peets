I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria with a strong interest in back-end development. Currently, I'm a Server Engineer Co-op at Blastworks Inc., where I work on back-end services using Go and Java.

Previously, I was a QA Automation Engineer at the same company, focusing on test automation and infrastructure using Rust, Python, and C#. During my two co-op terms, I spearheaded the test automation effort, bringing a long-term goal of the company to fruition, reducing test times from greater than 1 week down to 1-2 days per release.
